## Live Demo

[**Try the ACL Risk Predictor on Hugging Face Spaces**](https://huggingface.co/spaces/blazinbanana/ACL-Risk-Predictor)

> Upload your lunge video and get AI-powered ACL injury risk analysis instantly.
> - **Tips**: Record your video in Landscape view. Ensure there is only one person per video for accurate analysis. You can use Front View and then Side View for a more comprehensive and accurate assessment

## Overview

> Real-time ACL injury risk assessment from lunge movements using computer vision and deep learning.  
> Designed for athletes, rehab clinics, and biomechanics research.


## Business & Market Potential

The ACL Injury Risk Predictor bridges the gap between sports science, injury prevention, and accessible AI-driven analytics. Designed for both athletic performance monitoring and clinical rehabilitation, the system provides actionable movement insights using only video input.


## Target Users

> Sports Medicine Clinics â€“ For pre-season screening and return-to-play assessments.

> Athletic Teams & Coaches â€“ To monitor form and identify high-risk movement patterns early.

> Rehabilitation Centers â€“ To track progress post-surgery or during physiotherapy.

> Fitness & Training Platforms â€“ To integrate movement risk analysis for users and trainers.


## Value Proposition

> **Prevent costly injuries** â€“ ACL tears can cost $5,000â€“$20,000 in surgery and recovery; early detection helps reduce risk.

> **Affordable biomechanics** insights â€“ Delivers motion analysis comparable to lab-grade systems at a fraction of the cost.

> **Scalable deployment** â€“ Works on ordinary cameras.

> **Data-driven decisions** â€“ Enable objective tracking of athlete performance and joint health trends over time.
